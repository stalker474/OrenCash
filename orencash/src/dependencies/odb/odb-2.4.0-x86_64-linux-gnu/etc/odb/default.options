# Default ODB options file. This file is automatically loaded by the ODB
# compiler and can be used for installation-wide customizations, such as
# adding an include search path for a commonly used library. For example:
#
# -I /opt/boost_1_45_0
#

# Debian/Ubuntu new multiarch support places certain headers into
# /usr/include/<arch>. Add that path to the search list but use
# -idirafter to make sure it is used as a last resort only.
#
-idirafter /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
