# OrenCash
A simplistic crypto-currency implementation inspired by Naivecoin project
Original project : https://github.com/conradoqg/naivecoin

In order to fully understand the crypto-development environment I decided to build this little project, which is basically a simplistic blockchain based currency.
I believe this to be the easiest way to understand what's going on in the crypto world, without digging deep into the complexity of the current bitcoin and eth implementation.
