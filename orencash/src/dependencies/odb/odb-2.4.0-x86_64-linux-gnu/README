ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the pre-compiled binary distribution of the ODB
compiler. The top-level directory structure of this package is as
follows:

bin/          ODB compiler binary
etc/          ODB compiler configuration
doc/          ODB system documentation
man/          man pages for the ODB compiler
<arch>-<os>/  GCC compiler binaries, see manifest inside for details

To install this package simply unpack it into a directory of your choice,
for example /opt/. You can run the ODB compiler by either using the
absolute path, for example:

/opt/odb-x.y.z-i686-linux-gnu/bin/odb --version

Or you can add the bin/ directory to the PATH environment variable, for
example:

export PATH=/opt/odb-x.y.z-i686-linux-gnu/bin:$PATH
odb --version

If you have commonly-used libraries that are not installed into one of the
default locations (normally /usr/include and /usr/local/include) and you
would like to add them to the ODB compiler header search list, then you
can add their include directories to the etc/odb/default.options file.
For more information, refer to the instructions at the beginning of this
file.

Note also that while you can move the ODB compiler directory around, you
cannot move individual sub-directories or files inside it. For example,
copying or linking the ODB compiler executable to /usr/local/bin/ will
not work.
